This course is an Audit Course initiated by NIIT University for enhancing the overall development of the students studying in nearby Government schools which do not have much facilities to support quality education.

This repository consists of the following:

1. The lesson plans that were taught to the students on visit to schools

2. The reports highlighting the local flora and fauna and the school visits

3. A review article the Community Connect program

This course was opted by me voluntarily as a co-ordinator so as to get the chance of helping the students in their overall development.
